# this dorctory talks about cookies and session in flask
when ever we want to communicate with a server the password and username is sent to the server which verify it and creates a session token 
and send it back to the client, the server then stores it as cookie and use it everytime he want to make a request to the server as a header
this keeps the server and the clent connected
